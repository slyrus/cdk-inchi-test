* CDK-InChI tests

This is a self-contained example of loading the CDK in ABCL and trying to call the InChI routines. In order to get this to work, I have to manually the aarch64 version of libjnainchi.dylib in /usr/local/lib.

To load this, make sure this directory is on the asdf:*central-registry* path, or that there's a link to this directory in ~/quicklisp/local-projects, if you're using quicklisp.

* To Load

#+begin_src sh :session
(pushnew *default-pathname-defaults* asdf:*central-registry*)

#+end_src

Then load with:

#+begin_src sh :session
(asdf:load-system "cdk-inchi-test")

#+end_src
